# Quant Learning Diary
This is Jeho's quant learning diary, basically we have a lot of notebooks containing explanation from basics to professional I hope hehe. This serve as a documentation for Jeho. 

This repo is made that someday I may turn this into a full sylabus of practical quant trading.

Before starting anything there's some books that I recommend you to read because it has been really insightful for me in reading these books:
- Algorithmic Trading by Ernest P.Chan
- Quantitative Trading by Ernest P.Chan
